Touch-enabled slider powered by Swiper.js. Put any content inside and each child becomes a slide automatically - no extra markup needed. Supports navigation arrows, pagination, autoplay, and multiple transition effects.

### How it works

Drop child elements inside the container and the transform wraps each one as a swiper slide. Swipe with touch, drag with mouse, or navigate with arrows and keyboard. Works with images, cards, text blocks, or any HTML content.

### Effects

Six transition effects built in. Slide is the standard horizontal movement. Fade cross-dissolves between slides. Coverflow creates a 3D perspective with depth and rotation - looks great for image galleries. Cards stacks slides like a deck of cards that you swipe through. Cube and flip add 3D rotation transitions.

### Navigation and pagination

Navigation arrows give users prev/next buttons. Pagination comes in three styles - bullets (dots), fraction (1/5), and progress bar. A draggable scrollbar is also available. All three can be combined.

### Multiple slides

Show more than one slide at a time by setting slides-per-view. Add spacing between them, center the active one, or enable free-mode scrolling where slides don't snap to position. Slides-per-view also accepts "auto" to size slides based on their content width.

### Autoplay

Slides can advance automatically with a configurable delay. Pause on hover gives users time to interact. Combined with loop mode, it creates an infinite carousel that cycles continuously - good for hero banners, testimonials, and product showcases.
