Interactive map powered by Leaflet.js. Drop it onto any page to show a fully functional map with markers, popups, and different visual styles - no API key needed.

### Markers

Add child elements with latitude and longitude coordinates to place markers on the map. Each marker can have a popup that opens on click - supports plain text or HTML for rich content like bold text, links, and line breaks. Put an emoji or HTML inside the child element to use it as a custom marker icon, or leave it empty for the default Leaflet pin.

### Tile styles

Ships with six built-in tile styles. Streets is the standard OpenStreetMap look. Light and dark are clean minimal styles from CartoDB - dark works well on dark-themed pages. Voyager is a modern colorful style, also from CartoDB. Satellite pulls aerial imagery from Esri. Topo shows topographic detail with elevation contours from OpenTopoMap.

### Controls

Zoom buttons, scroll wheel zoom, and map dragging are all enabled by default. Turn them off individually to create a static decorative map that users can look at but not interact with - useful for contact pages or location cards where you just want to show where something is.

### Sizing

The map height is set in pixels and defaults to 400. Width always fills its container. The map automatically adjusts when the container resizes, so it works well in responsive layouts.
