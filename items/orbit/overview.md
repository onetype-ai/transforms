Arrange elements in a circular orbit with gentle floating motion. Each item drifts independently with random direction and timing, creating an organic, living layout that feels like things are gently hovering in space.

### How it works

Drop any child elements inside the container and they get positioned in a circle automatically. The spacing is evenly distributed with slight randomness, so it feels natural rather than rigid. Each element gets its own drift animation with random speed and direction - no two items float the same way.

The container sizes itself based on the largest orbit radius, so you don't need to set dimensions manually.

### Multi-ring layouts

Each child element can have its own radius, which makes it possible to create multiple concentric rings. Put some items on an inner ring with a small radius and others on an outer ring with a larger one. Combined with a center label or icon, this creates a solar system-like layout that works great for tech stacks, feature overviews, or ecosystem diagrams.

### Angles

By default, items spread evenly around the circle with a bit of randomness. If you need precise placement, set a fixed angle on individual elements. Angles are in degrees - 0 is right, 90 is bottom, 180 is left, 270 is top.

### Motion

The floating drift gives each element a gentle back-and-forth movement. Increase the drift distance for a more dramatic effect, or reduce it for something barely noticeable. The speed controls how fast each drift cycle completes - slower feels calmer, faster feels more energetic.
