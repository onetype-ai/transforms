Child elements arranged in orbit around a central point with gentle floating motion. Each element drifts independently with random direction and timing, creating an organic, living layout.

Positions randomize slightly on each page load. Each child can have its own radius for multi-ring layouts.

### Options (on the parent)

- **radius** — default orbit radius in pixels (default: 150)
- **drift** — floating distance in pixels (default: 15)
- **speed** — drift cycle duration in seconds (default: 3)

### Per-child attributes

- **radius** — override orbit radius for this element
- **angle** — fixed starting angle in degrees (default: evenly distributed with slight randomness)
