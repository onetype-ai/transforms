Side-by-side image comparison with a draggable slider. Drop in two images and users can slide between them to see the difference.

### How it works

Put two images inside the element - the first one is "before", the second is "after". A divider line with a handle appears between them. Drag it left and right (or up and down in vertical mode) to reveal more of either image.

The slider uses a native range input under the hood, so it works with keyboard navigation and screen readers out of the box. The handle snaps to where you click or drag, giving a smooth and responsive feel.

### Directions

Works in two directions - horizontal slides left to right, vertical slides top to bottom. Horizontal is the default and works best for most comparisons. Vertical is useful for landscape shots or long images where the change happens top-to-bottom.

### Labels

Optional text labels can be placed on each side of the divider to make it clear which image is which. Labels sit at the bottom corners and stay in place as the slider moves.

### Hover mode

Instead of dragging, hover mode moves the slider to follow the mouse cursor. This creates a more interactive feel - users just move their mouse over the image and the comparison follows naturally. Good for portfolio sites and product pages where you want instant interaction without requiring a click.
