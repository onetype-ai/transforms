Animated particle backgrounds powered by particles.js. Pick a preset, set a background color, and you get a living, breathing backdrop for hero sections, headers, or any part of the page.

### Presets

Ships with six built-in effects. Stars gives you a twinkling night sky with softly glowing dots. Snow drops white flakes that fall gently downward. Links is the classic particles.js look - dots connected by thin lines that react to mouse movement. Bubbles creates large translucent circles floating upward like an underwater scene. Confetti rains down colorful shapes. Fireflies produces warm glowing dots that pulse and drift randomly.

### Mouse interaction

Particles can react to the cursor in different ways. Grab mode connects nearby particles to the mouse with lines, creating a web effect as you move. Repulse pushes particles away from the cursor. Bubble makes particles grow when hovered. Click interactions can push new particles into the scene or remove them.

### Customization

Every preset can be tuned further. Change the particle count for density, adjust speed for energy, set custom colors to match your brand, and control the particle size. The links option can be toggled on any preset to draw connection lines between nearby particles.

### Layering

The particle container works great as a background layer. Place text, buttons, or cards on top with absolute positioning and a higher z-index. The particles animate underneath while the content stays readable and interactive.
